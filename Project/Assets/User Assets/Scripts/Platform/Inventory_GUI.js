They expand into the septum transversum as the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds. The dorsal pancreatic bud directly develops from the duodenal endoderm, whereas the ventral pancreatic bud originates from the proximal part of the hepatic diverticulum. Owing to the rotation of the duodenum the ventral bud comes to lie in the dorsal mesentery and fuses with the dorsal bud. The ventral bud forms the uncinate process and part of the pancreatic head. The remainder of the pancreas is derived from the dorsal bud. The definitive pancreatic duct derives from the ventral pancreas and drains off at the major duodenal papilla, whereas the drainage duct of the dorsal pancreas anastomoses with the ventral pancreatic duct and loses its original connection between the dorsal pancreas and the duodenum. It may persist as an accessory pancreatic duct that opens at the minor duodenal papilla.\n\nClinical information (Pancreas)\nAnnular pancreas\nWhen the merging process of both pancreatic buds partly fails, an annular pancreas can arise. In this anomaly, the ventral pancreatic bud lies (in part) around the duodenum following the embryonic pathway of migration, whereas it should be completely fused with the dorsal pancreatic bud after its migration. The hedgehoc signaling pathway seems to play a major part in this anomaly (Etienne et al., 2012). The incidence is 1 in every 1000 individuals (Etienne et al., 2012). These patients can suffer from symptoms of duodenal obstruction and therefore surgical intervention with bypass procedures might be necessary.\n\nAccessory pancreatic duct\nWhen there is no complete fusion of both pancreatic ducts, the accessory pancreatic duct from the dorsal pancreatic bud can remain in contact with the duodenum. An accessory pancreatic duct occurs in 5-10 % of the western population (Kamisawa, 2004). This is of clinical importance especially when an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has to be performed in patients suffering from an obstruction due to gallstones for example.";

It appears as an epithelial proliferation at the basis of the tongue in the floor of the pharynx in stage 13 (28-32 days). This epithelial proliferation will subsequently descent caudally towards the neck as a bilobed diverticulum. Its migrational path lies ventral of the hyoid bone and the laryngeal cartilages. The thyroid gland reaches its final destination in front of the trachea in stage 17 (42-44 days) approximately. By then it gains its typical ‘butterfly’ shape with a median isthmus, pointing cranially, towards the path of migration, and two slim lateral lobes, but it remains connected with the tongue by a narrow canal, the thyroglossal duct. This duct regresses in stage 15 (35-38 days) and 16 (37-42 days).\n\nThyroid hormone production will reach clinical significant levels at about 18 weeks of development (Pescovitz and Eugster, Pediatric endocrinology: mechanisms, manifestations and management, 2004, page 493).\n\nClinical information (Thyroid gland)\nThyroglossal cysts\nThe persistent thyroglossal duct or the existence of thyroglossal cysts is the most common clinically significant anomaly of the thyroid gland. Segments of the thyroglossal duct that did not regress properly can give rise to cysts, filled with clear mucinous secretions. These cystic remnants of the thyroglossal duct follow the migrational path of the thyroid gland and can thus be found ventral of the trachea in the midline of the neck or at the base of the tongue. These benign cysts are rarely larger then 2 to 3 centimeters in diameter and can occur at any age. Cysts close to the thyroid gland are often lined by epithelium resembling the thyroidal acinar epithelium, whereas cysts that are situated closer to the basis of the tongue are more often lined with stratified squamous epithelium, just as the basis of the tongue. Approximately 1% of the cysts give rise to thyroglossal duct carcinomas (Chou et al. 2012).\n\nAberrant thyroid tissue\nPost mortem studies suggested that 7 to 10% of the adults harbor asymptomatic aberrant thyroid tissue along the migratory path of the thyroid gland (Sauk, 1970). This thyroid tissue can be found anywhere along the thyroglossal duct, but the lingual thyroid is the most common type, accounting for 90% of the cases (Ibrahim and Fadeyibi, 2011).

The most cranial segments collectively constitute the pronephros in amphibians and fish, the intermediate segments the mesonephros, and the most caudal part of the urogenital ridge constitutes the metanephros. In higher vertebrate embryos, a pronephros proper is not present.The urinary component of the urogenital ridge is called the nephrogenic cord, which gives rise to the mesonephros in stage 12 (26-30 days) and the metanephros in stage 14 (31-35 days) and their ducts, the mesonephric duct and the ureter respectively.\n\nMesonephros\nThe mesonephros is formed in all vertebrates. It serves as the adult kidney in anamniotes, but degenerates during development of the amniotes, which, in turn, develop a more complex metanephros (Wessely and Tran, 2011). The mesonephros develops during stage 12 (26-30 days) in a craniocaudal sequence. It is a functional structure in human embryos and serves as the excretory embryonic kidney. Later on it also degenerates in a craniocaudal sequence from the 5th to 12th weeks of gestational age.\n\nMesonephric duct\nThe excretory duct of the mesonephros develops in craniocaudal fashion from the cervical region towards the cloaca. In the stage 13 (28-32 days) embryo the mesonephric duct does not reach the cloaca yet. It contributes to the metanephros by forming the ureteric bud in stage 14 (31-35 days).

The optic vesicle develops as lateral outpocketing from the wall of the forebrain, the prosencephalon. The wall of the optic vesicle therefore consists of neural ectoderm that surrounds the cavity of the optic vesicle, which is still part of the lumen of the neural tube. The part of the optic vesicle that lays in the direct proximity of the surface ectoderm induces this ectoderm to form the lens. This first stage of lens development is typically for a stage 13 embryo (28-32 days). In stage 14 (31-35 days), the lens placode invaginates towards the optic cup, giving the optic vesicle the shape of a cup (optic cup) and in stage 15 (35-38 days) the lens is completely loose from the surface ectoderm and after detaching it becomes almost completely embraced by the optic cup. In the final situation, the optic cup gives rise to the pigment and neural layers of the retina and the optic stalk, also commonly known as optic nerve. Before complete closure of the optic stalk and the retina, the hyaloid artery becomes enclosed in the optic cup. This artery will nourish the developing lens and will fully regress before birth.\n\nTechnical reconstruction information:\nIn human embryos the ectodermal thickening of the lens placode is not that obvious as one would expect and is therefore difficult to annotate morphologically.
